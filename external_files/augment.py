class RevEcho(nn.Module):
    """
    Hacky Reverb but runs on GPU without slowing down training.
    This reverb adds a succession of attenuated echos of the input
    signal to itself. Intuitively, the delay of the first echo will happen
    after roughly 2x the radius of the room and is controlled by `first_delay`.
    Then RevEcho keeps adding echos with the same delay and further attenuation
    until the amplitude ratio between the last and first echo is 1e-3.
    The attenuation factor and the number of echos to adds is controlled
    by RT60 (measured in seconds). RT60 is the average time to get to -60dB
    (remember volume is measured over the squared amplitude so this matches
    the 1e-3 ratio).

    At each call to RevEcho, `first_delay`, `initial` and `RT60` are
    sampled from their range. Then, to prevent this reverb from being too regular,
    the delay time is resampled uniformly within `first_delay +- 10%`,
    as controlled by the `jitter` parameter. Finally, for a denser reverb,
    multiple trains of echos are added with different jitter noises.

    Args:
        - initial: amplitude of the first echo as a fraction
            of the input signal. For each sample, actually sampled from
            `[0, initial]`. Larger values means louder reverb. Physically,
            this would depend on the absorption of the room walls.
        - rt60: range of values to sample the RT60 in seconds, i.e.
            after RT60 seconds, the echo amplitude is 1e-3 of the first echo.
            The default values follow the recommendations of
            https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2001/2001.08662.pdf, Section 2.4.
            Physically this would also be related to the absorption of the
            room walls and there is likely a relation between `RT60` and
            `initial`, which we ignore here.
        - first_delay: range of values to sample the first echo delay in seconds.
            The default values are equivalent to sampling a room of 3 to 10 meters.
        - repeat: how many train of echos with differents jitters to add.
            Higher values means a denser reverb.
        - jitter: jitter used to make each repetition of the reverb echo train
            slightly different. For instance a jitter of 0.1 means
            the delay between two echos will be in the range `first_delay +- 10%`,
            with the jittering noise being resampled after each single echo.
        - keep_clean: fraction of the reverb of the clean speech to add back
            to the ground truth. 0 = dereverberation, 1 = no dereverberation.
        - sample_rate: sample rate of the input signals.
