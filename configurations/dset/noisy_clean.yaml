train: egs/valentini/tr  # path to train folder, should contain both a noisy.json and clean.json file
valid: egs/valentini/cv  # path to the validation folder.
                     # If not set, the last epoch is kept rather than the best
test: egs/valentini/tt   # Path to the test set. Metrics like STOI and PESQ are evaluated on it
                     # every `eval_every` epochs.
enh: egs/valentini/enh   # Path to the enh set. enhanced audio for these files is saved every `eval_every` epochs.
noisy_json: egs/valentini/tt/noisy.json  # files to enhance. Those will be stored in the experiment
                                     # `samples` folder for easy subjective evaluation of the model.

matching: sort       # how to match noisy and clean files. For Valentini, use sort, for DNS, use dns.
